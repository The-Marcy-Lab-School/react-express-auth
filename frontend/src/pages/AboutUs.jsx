    <p id = "p1">iQFood is a place where the general public can be well-informed about the effects of processed foods one consumes and their impact on our bodies. With this information, individuals will be educated and aware of how much damage processed foods can do to our bodies. With that people will read about how they can make better decisions and create better dietary choices and meal plans to help with their health. While investing in unprocessed foods may appear financially burdensome, refraining from formulating meal plans or persisting with processed food consumption can incur substantial expenses over an extended period of time. iQFood increases awareness and informed decision-making contributing to positive dietary shifts and ultimately promoting a healthier population overall.</p>
