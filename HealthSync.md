# HealthSync

## Mission Statement
At HealthSync, our mission is to empower individuals in Brooklyn on their fitness journey by fostering a community-driven platform focused on exercise events, education, and personal growth.

## Who We Serve
Our service is tailored for individuals in Brooklyn who are new to fitness, particularly those with little to no prior exercise experience or knowledge, offering a nurturing community, easy-to-follow guidance, and accessible resources to confidently embark on their fitness journey.

## Product Overview
HealthSync is an application where users can sign up to create and browse exercise events anywhere in Brooklyn. Each event created will have a location, time, and description of the event. Event creators are incentivized to be detailed in their event descriptions. Users can find routes to the location and choose to join, receiving updates on the events they joined. Events will have tags, allowing users to filter events by tags such as walking, biking, or yoga in the search engine. This page will enable beginners to quickly find groups and activities to aid their fitness journey. There will also be a secondary educational page where users can find a variety of exercises with in-depth search capabilities, filtering by cardio, weighted exercises, calisthenics, and whether gym equipment or setup is needed. This provides the best set of exercises suited for the user. If a user chooses an exercise, they will be more likely to see event posts that will likely incorporate that exercise. There will also be a page for note-taking and journaling, where users can take notes on exercises or journal their progress on their fitness journey.

## Summary
According to the New York Department of Health, Brooklyn has the highest number of obese people than any other borough (Environment and Health Data Portal, 2020). Many individuals struggle to start their fitness journey due to a lack of motivation or knowledge. Intrinsic motivation, deriving joy from the activity itself, is crucial for long-term commitment (Iowa State University Department of Kinesiology, 2021).

## The Problem
Brooklyn faces a distinctive challenge with obesity rates higher than most other areas in New York City. HealthSync recognizes the unique barriers that individuals in Brooklyn encounter when trying to maintain their health and wellness. A significant issue is the lack of cohesive community support and motivation, which are crucial for embarking on and sustaining fitness journeys. Many residents struggle to find reliable and relevant information that resonates with their lifestyle and environment, making it difficult to effectively manage weight, monitor caloric intake, and maintain regular fitness routines.

## Solution
HealthSync aims to foster greater motivation through community support. With a unified and user-friendly platform, residents of Brooklyn can gain a clearer understanding of their health metrics and make informed decisions about their fitness and nutritional needs. HealthSync is designed not just for tracking health data but to create a sense of community and encouragement. By cultivating a virtual community, it provides a supportive environment essential for motivation. This is particularly crucial in Brooklyn, where communal ties significantly influence lifestyle changes.
