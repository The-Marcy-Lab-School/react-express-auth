## Getting Started

Before you can actually start building, you need to create a database and configure your server's environment variables to connect with it.

- Create a database with a name of your choice.
- In the `server/` folder, copy the `.env.template` and name it `.env`.
- Update the `.env` variables to match your Postgres database information (username, password, database name)
- Replace the `SESSION_SECRET` value with your own random string. This is used to encrypt the cookie's `userId` value.
  - Use a tool like [https://randomkeygen.com/](https://randomkeygen.com/) to help generate the secret.
- Your `.env` file should look something like this:

```sh
# Replace these variables with your Postgres server information
# These values are used by knexfile.js to connect to your postgres server
PG_HOST='127.0.0.1'
PG_PORT=5432
PG_USER='itsamemario'
PG_PASS='12345'
PG_DB='my_react_express_auth_database'

# Replace session secret with your own random string!
# This is used by handleCookieSessions to hash your cookie data 
SESSION_SECRET='db8c3cffebb2159b46ee38ded600f437ee080f8605510ee360758f6976866e00d603d9b3399341b0cd37dfb8e599fff3'

# When you deploy your database on render, this string can be used to test SQL queries to the deployed database.
# Leave this value blank until you deploy your database.
PG_CONNECTION_STRING=''
```

### Build and Start Commands

```sh
# Build Command â€” install dependencies, build the static assets, and run migrations/seeds
cd frontend && npm i && npm run build && cd ../server && npm i && npm run migrate && npm run seed && cd ..

# Start Command
cd server && npm start
```
